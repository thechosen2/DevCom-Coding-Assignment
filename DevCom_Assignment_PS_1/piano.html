        <h2>Piano</h2>
        <p style="width: 75%;">As a person who loves music, I started with piano when I was very young. I love the idea of being able to create your own music, and aim to be atleast proficient enough to play all my favourite songs and themes on it one day. <br><br> I have a visharad degree in indian classical keyboard, but these days I'm <br> much more interested in western music and mostly just learning the covers to the OSTs of my favourite video games.</p>
