        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p style="width: 75%;">I have been coding for as long as I can remember, having written my first program on QBASIC about 10 years ago. <br><br> Then came Java, then C++, and my school teacher introduced me to Competitive Programming. I immediately fell in love and started giving olympiads. I have given ZCO thrice and qualified for INOI every time, being one of the youngest to do so from my zone back when I gave it in 2018. <br><br> Then pandemic hit, and came the era of Discord. I turned leveraged the Discord python API to create bots to annoy my friends on our little server. <br><br> Because of my love for coding, I think I would be a great addition to DevCom. Even though I have very little experience in web/app dev, I'm willing to learn, and I think this website proves it!</p>
