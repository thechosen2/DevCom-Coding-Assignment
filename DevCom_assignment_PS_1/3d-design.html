        <h2>3D</h2>
        <p style="width:75%;">I like everything 3D: modelling, designing, animating.<br><br> I think I first got into blender because I wanted to create my own video games. Then, after a long and arduous series of donuts, I finally started getting the hang of it. <br><br> The background of this webpage is completely made by me in blender. It is definitely one of the, if not the best work I have done in 3D.</p>
