# PS1:
I have tried to create a website that encapsulates me as a person and i'm pretty happy with the result. Try to click around, there's lots of hidden animations and easter eggs you can find!
# Running it
The assignment 1 is a simple website i built in vscode, it will work if you have downloaded the folder completely and then are running it using the liveserver extension. The typeit library i have used will requre an internet connection to actually work. But, I have ensured that the text still displays even when offline. I have also used a service called web3forms for the mailing aspect of it.
