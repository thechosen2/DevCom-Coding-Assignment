# Preface
(i dont know how to write readme files)
I'm Pranav Malpani, a Btech student in the EE department here at IIT Bombay, and this is my submission for devcom's recruitment assignment.
# PS1:
I have tried to create a website that encapsulates me as a person and i'm pretty happy with the result. Try to click around, there's lots of hidden animations and easter eggs you can find!
# PS2:
I have tried to solve the problem as i understood it. According to me, we had to take care of the SyncService class which i have done to the best of my ability. I have uploaded both the jupyter notebook and the python file of the same code so that there is no inconvenience. 

# Running the Code:
The assignment 1 is a simple website i built in vscode, it will work if you have downloaded the folder completely and then are running it using the liveserver extension. The typeit library i have used will requre an internet connection to actually work. But, I have ensured that the text still displays even when offline. I have also used a service called web3forms for the mailing aspect of it.

As for assignment 2, i edited and ran the code on colab itself, but other methods of running it should also work, i dont see any possible problems with that.
